# Aggregated gemlog for all users of tilde.club

While this is an aggregated gemlog for all users, this does not imply that it is also a list of all posts. For one thing, this aggregated gemlog only includes links that follow the gemini companion specification for subscribing to text/gemini pages. For another, it only includes links found in one of only a few prominent entry points that are suspected of containing gemlogs (such as the main index.gmi file of a capsule or a file called gemlog.gmi, for example). If you are a tilde.club user and your gemlog is not included in the list, please feel free to request its inclusion by sending an email to seifferth@tilde.club.
